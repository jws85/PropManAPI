WARNING:  This is a working application I am writing for a family member, but
it is also sort of a "playground" for technologies that I feel I ought to
learn.  As such, it is probably going to be in flux at any given time, and the
installation instructions are not going to be super helpful.  Once I come
closer to a non-beta sort of release, I'll clean this readme up...

This is the backend API for PropMan.  I'll add a link here to the frontend
application when I put that up...

As of writing, you need the following to install:

 - node.js
 - npm
 - SQLite 3

If you are on a systemd-based Linux distro (Fedora, Arch), you can also pull in
the following to install this as a background daemon:

 - make

LICENSE:  MIT.  This is a pretty cut-and-dried CRUD "RESTful" API; IMHO the
educational value of a simple, practical node.js example outweighs any monetary
compensation I might get from this...
