WARNING:  This is a working application I am writing for a family member, but
it is also sort of a "playground" for technologies that I feel I ought to
learn.  As such, it is probably going to be in flux at any given time, and the
installation instructions are not going to be super helpful.  Once I come
closer to a non-beta sort of release, I'll clean this readme up...

This is the backend API for PropMan.

As of writing, you need the following to install:

 - node.js
 - npm
 - SQLite 3

If you are on a systemd-based Linux distro (Fedora, Arch), you can also pull in
the following to install this as a background daemon:

 - make
